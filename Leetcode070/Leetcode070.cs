   Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: n = 2
   Output: 2
   Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
   1. 1 step + 1 step
   2. 2 steps

   Example 2:
   
   Input: n = 3
   Output: 3
   Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
   1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
   2. 1 step + 2 steps
   3. 2 steps + 1 step
